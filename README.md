Analysis
The analysis below compares Capomulin's effectiveness in combating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) against other available medications.

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, 
tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, 
Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Analysis across the full dataset showed Capomulin-treated mice exhibit the smallest tumor volumes with the narrowest variance across all 
other treatment options including the placebo. The Capomulin treatment seemed to have also allowed the largest number of observations. The Capomulin treatment comes at the hills of another substance Ramicane - treatement with the most promising results in the group. Further comparitive 
analysis would be necessary to determine if results offered by Capomulin are significantly different than those achieved by Ramicane.
